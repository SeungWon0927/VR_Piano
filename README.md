# VR_Piano


Available in Oculus Quest. With Oculus Quest's inbuilt function, Hand Tracking, this program allows the user to play a virtual piano by moving real fingers (not controller).

Created in Unity Ver 2019.2.18f1

To save github's storage, used gitignore = "Unity". And so there is no 'apk' file

Playable with Oculus Quest - **Open "PianoScene" Scene in "PianoProject" folder inside "Assets" = Assets -> PianoProject -> PianoScene**


Mainly used C# and Unity's collision functions

Recommended to play in bright place since Oculus Quest can not track hands correctly in dark environment
Since Hand Tracking fundtion is Beta version, besides of brightness, it is very unstable. So only one finger for each hands is the best to generate clear sounds.

To watch how it works, go to my project web, "https://www.notion.so/purdueseungwon/Seung-Won-Kim-s-Works-42199ff8965741f19480821a4cd61d23", and check "VR Piano Playing" section
